### **Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion**
- Unity Catalog volume creation and management
- Modern XML processing with Spark
- Delta table creation with proper governance metadata
- Understanding immutable data storage principles

### **Silver Layer: Data Transformation & Quality**
- Timestamp parsing and data type conversion
- Business logic implementation and categorization
- Data quality validation and monitoring
- Schema evolution and handling data changes

### **Gold Layer: Analytics & Business Intelligence**
- Daily aggregations and summary statistics
- Evidence-based scoring algorithms (applies to any domain)
- Pattern analysis and trend identification
- Creating dashboard-ready datasets

### **Production Optimization**
- Delta Lake ZORDER BY for 10x query performance

### 🛠️ Optimization Commands

```sql
-- Reorganize data for common query patterns
OPTIMIZE health_data.gold.daily_health_summary
ZORDER BY (activity_date, metric_category);

-- Enable automatic optimization
ALTER TABLE health_data.gold.daily_health_summary
SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
);
```


## 🏗️ Architecture You'll Build

**Medallion Architecture (Industry Standard):**
- **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion with full audit trail
- **Silver Layer** → Cleaned, validated, business-ready data
